Spanish is the third most spoken language in the world, following English and Chinese. Learning it has been a challenging but immensely rewarding journey.

### **Starting Small: Duolingo and the Power of Habit**  

My Spanish journey began with Duolingo. Its gamified approach made learning fun and unintimidating. Spending just 10 minutes a day on short lessons became a sustainable habit. While Duolingo is a great way to get started and build vocabulary, I quickly realized that advancing in a language requires more structured and immersive learning.

2. **Easy Spanish Step-by-Step** by Barbara Bregstein â€“ This book provided a systematic approach to mastering Spanish grammar, making complex concepts digestible.  
3. **Portales 2** â€“ An excellent intermediate-level book for broadening language skills.  
4. **Intrigas: Advanced Spanish Through Literature and Film (3rd Edition)** â€“ This introduced me to Spanish literature and films, enriching my cultural understanding.  
5. **Revista, 6th Edition: ConversaciÃ³n sin barreras** â€“ Focused on improving conversational skills through thought-provoking content.  

Each book added layers of depth to my learning, helping me progress beyond the basics.

### **Listening: Spanish Podcasts**  

Listening to Spanish became an essential part of my routine, and podcasts were a convenient way to immerse myself in the language. Two podcasts stood out:  

- **Coffee Break Spanish** â€“ Perfect for beginners and intermediate learners, this podcast taught me practical phrases and grammar tips. I often listened while driving, walking, or doing household chores.  
- **Duolingo Spanish Podcast** â€“ This storytelling-based podcast caters to intermediate learners. Its mix of English and Spanish narration helped me follow along while gradually increasing my listening comprehension.

### **Watching: Spanish TV Shows and Movies**  

To truly immerse myself, I started watching Spanish TV shows and movies. These not only improved my listening skills but also gave me a window into Spanish-speaking cultures.  

- **Favorite TV Show:**  
  - **La Casa de Papel (Money Heist)** â€“ The gripping plot and brilliant acting made it impossible to stop watching.  

- **Movies I Loved:**  
  - **El Laberinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)** â€“ A hauntingly beautiful fantasy film.  
  - **Tambien la Lluvia (Even the Rain)** â€“ A thought-provoking exploration of history and politics.  
  - **Roma** â€“ An Academy Award-winning masterpiece.  
  - **Contratiempo (The Invisible Guest)** â€“ A thrilling mystery that keeps you guessing.  
  - **El Cuerpo (The Body)** â€“ Another suspenseful gem.  
  - **La Lengua de Las Mariposas (Butterfly's Tongue)** â€“ A poignant story of innocence and loss.

### **Reflections and Whatâ€™s Next**  

Looking back, learning Spanish has been more than just acquiring a new languageâ€”itâ€™s been a journey of personal growth, cultural appreciation, and expanding my horizons. From daily Duolingo lessons to diving into literature, podcasts, and films, every step has brought me closer to fluency.  

As I celebrate this four-year milestone, Iâ€™m excited about what lies ahead. My goal is to continue improving my speaking skills through conversation practice and to explore more complex texts and media in Spanish.  

To anyone considering learning a new language, I wholeheartedly encourage you to take the plunge. The journey is as rewarding as the destination.
